- Vanilla JS
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I really enjoyed this one, because it was a mix of a lot of things with some small, but nice challenges along the way. I also liked the modern and clean look of the design. Not cluttered, straight to the point. I've realized that these challenges not only help me to practice HTML/CSS/JS skills, but also train my eye for some good design. Because as a front-end developer, you need to have some basic understanding of UI/UX design. In brief, I achieved all the goals within the project, provided by Frontend Mentor and also the ones that I came up with. On to the next one!!!
